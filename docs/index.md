# Falco operator

<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/)
deploying and managing [Falco](https://falco.org/) on physical or virtual machines. Falco is a
open-source cloud native security tool that provides runtime security across hosts, containers,
Kubernetes, and cloud environments.

Like any Juju charm, this charm supports one-line deployment, configuration, integration, scaling, and more.

This charm will make operating Falco simple and straightforward for DevOps or SRE teams through
Juju's clean interface. For information about how to deploy, integrate, and manage this charm, see
the Official [Falco Operator Documentation](https://charmhub.io/falco).
