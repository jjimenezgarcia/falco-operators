# Security overview

<!-- Remember to update this file for your charm!!

This document outlines the security design of the charm along common risks and
possible best practices.

Elaborate on topics such as common risks, good practices, built-in protection, etc.

Are there upstream security docs that we can point to? If so, include a
sentence like:
For details regarding upstream __charm_name__ configuration and broader security
considerations, please refer to the [official <software> documentation](link-to-upstream-docs).

## Risks
In most cases, it will be appropriate to include a specific heading
Risks under which known risks are listed and described. Include a subheading for best
practices for the user to follow to avoid or limit risks.

## Information security
In some cases a product will have particular information security implications
(concerned with potential for information loss, incorrect retention, unlawful disclosure
and so on). Notes on these should be gathered separately in the overview topic, or
in a topic of their own.
